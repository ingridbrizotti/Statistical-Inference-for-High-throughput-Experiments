# Statistical-Inference-for-High-throughput-Experiments
The objective is to show in a high-throughput experiment we can not rely just on p-value to check significance. In order to show this, I created a Monte Carlo simulation and apply a t-test. Also, the Bonferroni correction can reduce false positive.
